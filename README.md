# .NET-Mini-Projects

# PHILOSOPHY
My vision on code is that it should be written for humans, not for computers. This implies that code should be easy to read and easy to maintain. 
These base principles should not be violated once complexity of the code increases. 
I believe there is no 'perfect' code, it's always an elegant balance between simplicity, clarity, functionality, reusability, efficiency and coding- and runtime speed. 
Where thinking out of the box (creativity) is a great skill for a developer, it should not be mistaken with the diligence to stick the conventions (OOP, Naming, etc.) to not reduce interoperability with other developers
As the IT space is undergoing continuous (exponential) growth, I believe one of the most important skills is to be open minded towards new things and learn how to adapt and learn new things quickly.
Theorizing is great, however nothing beats practice in actualizing your potential, coding is no exception.
With practice comes error, on the journey to mastery this requires a great deal of patience and persistence empowered by a strong determination.

# NOTES
- Non-production code
- Raw initial code
- Non-refactored
- Non-chaos engineered
- Error-prone

# SUMMARY
This repository contains a small variety of mini-projects which fulfilled the purpose of praciticing with various C# concepts. There was no intent to create production ready code. 

The intent of this repository is to display my experience with all main aspects of the C# Language:
- Variables
- Conditionals
- Methods
- Classes
- Instantiation
- OOP
- Inheritance
- Interfaces
- Debugging
- Advanced Breakpoints
- Looping
- Overloads
- Extension Methods
- Abstract Classes
- Modifiers
- WinForms
- Unit Tests

# PROCESS
1. Creating app requirements
2. Pseudo code (plan project)
3. Write code
